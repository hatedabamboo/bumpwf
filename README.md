# [bumpwf](https://notes.hatedabamboo.me/project-bumpwf/) — Bump GitHub Actions Workflows

A CLI tool that scans `.github/workflows/` for outdated GitHub Actions and interactively (or silently) updates them. Also can replace current version (`actions/checkout@v4`) with the commit tag (`34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5`). Prevent those pesky clawed clankers from hijacking your workflows!

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/hatedabamboo/bumpwf@latest
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hatedabamboo/bumpwf
cd bumpwf
make
make install
```

## Usage

Run from the root of a git repository:

```sh
bumpwf [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Long form | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `-t` | `--tags` | Always use tags when updating (skips the prompt) |
| `-n` | `--count` | Number of latest tags to fetch (default 10) |
| `-s` | `--sha` | Always use commit hashes when updating (skips the prompt) |
| `-A` | `--update-all` | Update all outdated actions without prompting (uses hash by default; respects `-t` or `-s`) |
| `-r` | `--replace` | Convert pinned tags↔SHAs without upgrading versions |
| `-v` | `--verbose` | Enable verbose logging |
| `-V` | `--version` | Show version |
| `-h` | `--help` | Show usage |

`-t` and `-s` are mutually exclusive. `-A` and `-r` are mutually exclusive.

## Authentication

Set `GH_TOKEN` to a GitHub personal access token for authenticated API calls:

```sh
export GH_TOKEN="ghp_..."
bumpwf
```

Without a token, GitHub limits anonymous requests to 60/hour. If you hit the limit, either set `GH_TOKEN` or use a VPN.

## Example workflow usage

To utilize `bumpwf` capabilities in automatic fashion, you must create Fine-grained [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) with the following settings:

- **Name**: `WORKFLOW_TOKEN` (can be any)
- **Expiration**: any (recommended to set to 90 days)
- **Repository access**: select only repository you want to update the workflows in
- **Permissions**:
  - Contents: Read and write
  - Metadata (Required): Read-only
  - Pull requests: Read and write
  - Workflows: Read and write

Add the token to the repository secrets under the name `WORKFLOW_TOKEN` (can be any, but this name is used in the example). Copy the example workflow and save it under `.github/workflows/upgrade-workflows.yaml` (or any name you like).
